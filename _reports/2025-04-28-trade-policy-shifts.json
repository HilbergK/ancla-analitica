  "body": "# Trade Policy Shifts in Latin America\n\n## Overview\n\nThis report examines the recent shifts in trade policy across Latin American countries and analyzes their potential economic implications for the region. We focus on new bilateral agreements, changes to existing regional frameworks, and evolving relationships with major trading partners.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- Mexico's renegotiation of terms within the USMCA framework\n- Brazil's pivot toward increased trade with Asian markets\n- Chile's expansion of Pacific trade partnerships\n- Regional efforts to reduce dependence on traditional export commodities\n\n## Economic Implications\n\nThese policy shifts are likely to reshape trade flows within the region and globally. Our analysis suggests potential GDP growth increases of 0.5-1.2% for countries successfully diversifying their trade relationships, while those maintaining status quo policies may see stagnation in export growth.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBusinesses operating in the region should closely monitor these evolving trade dynamics and consider strategic adjustments to supply chains and market focus."
