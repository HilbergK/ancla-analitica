  "body": "# Economic Impact of Remittance Tax on Central America\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report analyzes the potential economic impact of proposed remittance taxes on Central American economies, with a particular focus on Guatemala. Our findings indicate that such taxes would significantly reduce remittance flows, negatively affecting household incomes, consumption, and overall economic stability in the region.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- Remittances constitute over 15% of Guatemala's GDP\n- A proposed 10% tax would reduce remittance flows by an estimated 12-18%\n- Household consumption could decrease by 3-5% nationwide\n- Rural communities would be disproportionately affected\n\n## Policy Implications\n\nPolicymakers should consider these economic impacts when evaluating remittance tax proposals, as the negative effects on Central American economies could potentially increase migration pressures rather than reduce them."
